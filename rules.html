                        <h4>Course Objectives</h4>
                        <p>The main point of this course is to have fun making art.  And to make art that is fun!</p>  
                        <p>But...what makes something fun?  And what makes something art?</p>
                        <p>In this course we will explore some of the many ways which artists have used games, and fun, to extend and challenge themselves and their audiences.</p>
                        
                        <p>Along the way we will consider Dada and Surrealist and Fluxus and Minimalist and Situationist and Relational and Political and Nonsense and Language and all sorts of other games in all sorts of mediums.</p>
                        <p>We will also look at the ways that games have influenced interface design of all kinds, and some lessons that we can take away from games as we try to design intuitive experiences, whether they be art or commercial projects.</p>
                        <p>Our final project will be a mixed reality project for the web.</p>
                        <p>This course also aims to introduce you to commputer programming, in the most fun way possible -- by making games.  But here's a fun thing: all of the coding assignments can be completed without computers if you choose.  I know, it sounds weird, but it actually works, that's how I design my courses.  If you dig coding, you'll get a good grounding in javascript using p5.js, html, a little python, 3d modeling and AR/VR in a framework called aframe.  If you don't dig coding, well at least you'll learn enough about code art to hopefully be inspired in your chosen medium and know enough to be able to tell coders what to make for you!</p>

                        <p>You may produce your games in any medium.  Instead of games, you may produce blueprints or sketches of games or you may produce movies about or using games, or you may produce poems or music or performance.  You should be willing to serve as a performer or cast member or audience member for your classmates.</p>
                        
                        <p>In addition to your game projects, you will be expected to complete regular assignments using the techniques and technologies which will be introduced in class, which will include 3D modeling, compositing and a variety of tools for computer game design/building.  These projects (along with other things you thik are interesting!) should be posted to your tumblr blog for everyone to see.  You must sign up for tumblr and give me the link so I can ink to it from the course web site or you won't pass the class.</p>
                        <p>If you have no experience with code but are interested to learn more please visit the <a href="resources.html">resources</a> page for a host of resources to help you along your way, and dont be afraid to ask.  You don't have to write any code in this class if you don't want to, games can be completed in all kinds of ways and all kinds of mediums.</p>
